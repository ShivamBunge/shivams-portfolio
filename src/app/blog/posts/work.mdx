## Role overview

As a **Software Engineer** at UBS, I work on backend and full‑stack features for internal financial applications used by global teams.  
My day‑to‑day work spans Java/Kotlin microservices, .NET services, REST APIs, and cloud infrastructure on Oracle Cloud (OCI).

## Key responsibilities

- Build and maintain REST APIs, data access layers, and integration with internal and third‑party systems.
- Collaborate with product owners, QA, and other engineers to refine requirements, estimate work, and deliver features end‑to‑end.
- Improve code quality via unit/integration tests, refactoring, and adherence to clean architecture and SOLID principles.
- Participate in code reviews, technical discussions, and production support when needed.

## Selected work

- Implemented new features and enhancements in existing microservices handling critical workflows for finance teams.
- Optimized database queries and service logic to reduce latency and improve performance under real‑world load.
- Contributed to deployment pipelines and environment configuration for services running on OCI.

## Tech stack

- Backend: Spring Boot, .NET
- Frontend: React / Next.js (for internal tools and UIs)
- Infrastructure: Oracle Cloud (OCI), Docker, Git, CI/CD

## What I focus on
